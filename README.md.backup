# SupplyBlocks

Integrates Blockchain Technology with Supply-Chain

---

## Introduction 

In today's world, supply-chain is an integral part of our daily lives. Whether its buying basic groceries from the supermarket or ordering a fancy item from your famous online retailers like Amazon, everything functions as seamlessly as it does only because every part in the supply-chain is functioning optimally and to its expected efficiency. 

In this intricate weave of connections that consists in the supply-chain network, the key area of concern comes in the form of security 
where traditional systems using archaic and centralized servers become vulnerable because of attacks like DDOS, SYN/UDP Floods and others which can potentially lead to server crashes and cost companies billions in revenue.

Also traditional username and password security can lead to vulnerabilities due to people using same passwords over multiple platforms and hackers often using this to their advantage and causing leaks to potentially put all of the platforms at risk that the user was connected to using that passphrase.

To ameliorate the standard of security and authentication we present the combination of Blockchain technology's with Supply-chain which potentially aims too rectify all the issues we faced in the traditional system.


## Why Blockchain?

Many people would debate if blockchain is the right technology to combine with the supply-chain due to its association with Bitcoin which doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to speed, efficiency and general robustness.

By far, it is clear to everyone that has followed Blockchain that it 5 main advantages when compared to traditional databases:

* Decentralization
* Security
* Immutability
* Transparency
* Smart Contracts

These 5 pillars define blockchain and make it one of the most secure data structures to maintain data while also providing sauperior security through hashing algorithms and digital signatures along with providing automation through the use of Smart Contracts which effectively eliminates the need for involving 3rd Parties.

But along with these features comes the cost of speed, performance and scalability which is the achilles heel when it comes to blockchain based systems and transactions.
